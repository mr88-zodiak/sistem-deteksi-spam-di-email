the time clock has stood the test of time read article now for the fun of it by elliot williams i was off at the chaos communication congress last weekend and one of the big attractions for one who is nerdily inclined is seeing all of the personal projects that everyone brings along with them inevitably someone would ask me what my favorite is maybe it s my decision paralysis maybe it s being forced to pick a favorite child on the spot or maybe it s just that i m not walking around ranking them but that question always left me drawing a blank but after a week of thinking about it i m pretty sure i know why i don t actually care what i think of other peoples projects i m simply stoked to talk to everyone who brought anything and bathe in the success and failure hearing about the challenges that they saw coming and then the new challenges they met along the way i want to know what the hacker thinks of their project what their intention was and how their story went i m just a spectator so i collected stories the overwhelming entirely non surprising result of listening to a couple hundred hackers talk about their projects they re all doing it for the fun of it simply for the grins and that held equally well for the supremely planned out and technical projects as well as their simpler i bought these surplus on ebay one night relatives we were sitting around and thought wouldn t it be fun was the start of nearly every story that s what i absolutely love about our community that people are hacking because it makes them happy and that the amazing variety of projects suggests an endless possibility for hacker happiness it s hard to come away from an event like that without being energized some of that comes from the sharing of ideas and brainstorming and hanging out with like minded folks but what i find most important is simply the celebration of the joy of the project for its own sake happy hacking from the blog as the hardware world turns by tom nardi tom looks back at read more how advanced autopilots make airplanes safer when humans go awol by maya posch a plane recently landed on emergency autopilot is this the future read more the rise and fall of the in car fax machines by lewin day for a brief while there were luxury cars with fax machines read more hackaday podcast episode visualizing sound and windows is a dog by hackaday editors what happened last week on hackaday the podcast will get you up to speed read more if you missed it it s not a leica it s a lumix the full sized wheeled articulated bus built for a movie benchmarking windows against itself from windows xp to windows exploring nintendo dd code remnants in ocarina of time the unreasonable effectiveness of the fourier transform never miss a hack terms of use privacy policy hackaday io hackaday com this email was sent to why did i get this unsubscribe from this list update preferences hackaday com s fair oaks ave ste pasadena ca usa,spam

skimming satellites on the edge of the atmosphere read article now crazy old machines by elliot williams al and i were talking about the ibm faa air traffic control computer system on the podcast it s a strange machine made up of a bunch of ibm system mainframes connected together to a common memory unit with all sorts of custom peripherals to support keeping track of airplanes in the sky absolutely go read the in depth article on that machine if it sparks your curiosity it got me thinking about how strange computers were in the early days and how boringly similar they ve all become just looking at the word sizes of old machines is a great example over the last say years things that do computing have had or even bit words you noticed the powers of two trend going on here right basically starting with the lowly intel it s been round numbers ever since on the other side of the timeline though you get strange beasts the classic pdp had bit words while its predecessors the pdp and pdp had bits and bits respectively factors of six there s a string of military guidance computers that had bit words while the apollo guidance computer ran bit words univac iii had bit words putting the bit harvard mark i to shame i wasn t there but it gives you the feeling that each computer is a unique almost hand crafted machine some must have made their odd architectural choices to suit particular functions others because some designer had a cleaver idea i m not a computer historian but i m sure that the word lengths must tell a number of interesting stories on the whole though it gives the impression of a time when each computer was it s own unique machine before the convergence of everything to roughly the same architectural ideas a much more hackery time for lack of a better word we still see echoes of this in the people who make their own retro computers these days either virtually on a breadboard or emulated in the fabric of an fpga it s not just nostalgia though but a return to a time when there was more creative freedom a time before bits took over from the blog tech in plain sight finding a flat tire by al williams think you know how remote tire pressure gauges work think again because al presents at least three ways read more marion stokes fought disinformation with vcrs by kristina panos the rise of hour tv news meant a lot of history falling to the wayside if marion stokes weren t recording it all on vhs read more size and units really do matter by al williams nvidia mis estimated the amount of copper they needed being off by a factor of and it was reported with a straight face in many places do we need more widespread numeracy read more hackaday podcast episode firearms sky driving and dumpster diving by hackaday editors what happened last week on hackaday the podcast will get you up to speed read more if you missed it washington state bill seeks to add firearms detection to d printers ac motor converted into dc ebike powerplant diy full stack farm automation what to do with a flash less esp c super mini board silica gel makes for better d prints touchless support leaves no mark never miss a hack terms of use privacy policy hackaday io hackaday com this email was sent to why did i get this unsubscribe from this list update preferences hackaday com s fair oaks ave ste pasadena ca usa,spam
